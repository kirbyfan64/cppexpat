CppExpat
========

This project is a wrapper over the Expat library that makes it more "C++-ic".

Requirements
*************
- A C++11 compiler
- Expat

Building
********

CppExpat is header-only. If you want to build the examples, you need to install `Fbuild <https://github.com/felix-lang/fbuild>`_. from Git and run::
   
   $ fbuild

To install CppExpat, run::
   
   $ fbuild install

Documentation
**************

The only documentation right now are the examples (``ex*.cpp``) and some 
not-well-written Doxygen/Breathe-based docs (see
`ReadTheDocs <http://cppexpat.readthedocs.org/>`_).
